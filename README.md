# 📝 Java Notes App

A simple **console-based Notes Manager** built with **Java File I/O**.  
This app lets you **add**, **view**, **search**, **delete**, and **clear** notes—all stored in a local text file (`notes.txt`).

## ✨ Features
- **Add Note**: Save a note to a text file (each note on a new line).
- **View All Notes**: Display all notes with line numbers.
- **Search Notes**: Find notes containing a keyword (case-insensitive).
- **Delete Note**: Remove a specific note by its number.
- **Clear All Notes**: Delete all notes with confirmation.
